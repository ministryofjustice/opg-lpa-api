He was ever thy friend.\"\n\nAkela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that made the shadows jump and quiver.\n\n\"Good!\" said Mowgli, staring round slowly. \"I see that ye are dogs.

Those nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of whom thou hast perhaps heard.\"\n\n\"I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told.\"\n\n\"But it is true. He is such a man-cub as never was,\" said Baloo. \"The best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides, I--we--love him, Kaa.\"\n\n\"Ts!

When the two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his voice, \"And so I shall have a tribe of my own, and lead them through the branches all day long.\"\n\n\"What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?\" said Bagheera.\n\n\"Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,\" Mowgli went on. \"They have promised me this. Ah!\"\n\n\"Whoof!\" Baloo's big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera's back, and as the boy lay between the big fore-paws he could see the Bear was angry.\n\n\"Mowgli,\" said Baloo, \"thou hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the Monkey People.\"\n\nMowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too, and Bagheera's eyes were as hard as jade stones.\n\n\"Thou hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people without a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame.\"\n\n\"When Baloo hurt my head,\" said Mowgli (he was still on his back), \"I went away, and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on me. No one else cared.\" He snuffled a little.\n\n\"The pity of the Monkey People!\" Baloo snorted. \"The stillness of the mountain stream! The cool of the summer sun! And then, man-cub?\"\n\n\"And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat, and they--they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said I was their blood brother except that I had no tail, and should be their leader some day.\"\n\n\"They have no leader,\" said Bagheera. \"They lie. They have always lied.\"\n\n\"They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken among the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do not hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up! Bad Baloo, let me up! I will play with them again.\"\n\n\"Listen, man-cub,\" said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder on a hot night. \"I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all the peoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees. They have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own, but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep, and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are without leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not drink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go; we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever heard me speak of the Bandar-log till today?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo had finished.\n\n\"The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds. They are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they have any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we do not notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads.\"\n\nHe had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down through the branches; and they could hear coughings and howlings and angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches.\n\n\"The Monkey-People are forbidden,\" said Baloo, \"forbidden to the Jungle-People. Remember.\"\n\n\"Forbidden,\" said Bagheera, \"but I still think Baloo should have warned thee against them.\"\n\n\"I--I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey People! Faugh!\"\n\nA fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking Mowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look up, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross each other's path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded tiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then they would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People to climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles over nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the Jungle-People could see them. They were always just going to have a leader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because their memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they compromised things by making up a saying, \"What the Bandar-log think now the jungle will think later,\" and that comforted them a great deal. None of the beasts could reach them, but on the other hand none of the beasts would notice them, and that was why they were so pleased when Mowgli came to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was.\n\nThey never meant to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything at all; but one of them invented what seemed to him a "
