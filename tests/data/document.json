Then Shere Khan would\r\nflatter them and wonder that such fine young hunters were content\r\nto be led by a dying wolf and a man's cub. \"They tell me,\" Shere\r\nKhan would say, \"that at Council ye dare not look him between the\r\neyes.\" And the young wolves would growl and bristle.\r\n\r\nBagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of\r\nthis, and once or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere\r\nKhan would kill him some day. Mowgli would laugh and answer: \"I\r\nhave the Pack and I have thee; and Baloo, though he is so lazy,\r\nmight strike a blow or two for my sake. Why should I be afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera--\r\nborn of something that he had heard. Perhaps Ikki the Porcupine\r\nhad told him; but he said to Mowgli when they were deep in the\r\njungle, as the boy lay with his head on Bagheera's beautiful black\r\nskin, \"Little Brother, how often have I told thee that Shere Khan\r\nis thy enemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"As many times as there are nuts on that palm,\" said Mowgli,\r\nwho, naturally, could not count. \"What of it? I am sleepy,\r\nBagheera, and Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like\r\nMao, the Peacock.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it;\r\nthe Pack know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know.\r\nTabaqui has told thee too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" said Mowgli. \"Tabaqui came to me not long ago with\r\nsome rude talk that I was a naked man's cub and not fit to dig\r\npig-nuts. But I caught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice\r\nagainst a palm-tree to teach him better manners.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a mischief-maker,\r\nhe would have told thee of something that concerned thee closely.\r\nOpen those eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare not kill thee in\r\nthe jungle. But remember, Akela is very old, and soon the day\r\ncomes when he cannot kill his buck, and then he will be leader no\r\nmore. Many of the wolves that looked thee over when thou wast\r\nbrought to the Council first are old too, and the young wolves\r\nbelieve, as Shere Khan has taught them, that a man-cub has no\r\nplace wit",

Is it difficult?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: \"What matter?\r\nHe will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What\r\nharm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is\r\nthe bull, Bagheera?
