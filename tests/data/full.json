Then there were wicked, bitter howls from the young wolves:\r\n\"Akela! Akela! Let the Lone Wolf show his strength. Room for\r\nthe leader of the Pack! Spring, Akela!\"\r\n\r\nThe Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for Mowgli\r\nheard the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked\r\nhim over with his forefoot.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the\r\nyells grew fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where\r\nthe villagers lived.\r\n\r\n\"Bagheera spoke truth,\" he panted, as he nestled down in some\r\ncattle fodder by the window of a hut. \"To-morrow is one day both\r\nfor Akela and for me.\"\r\n\r\nThen he pressed his face close to the window and watched the\r\nfire on the hearth.

The screen-work broke and fell away\r\nin a cloud of dust and rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the\r\nopening and flung himself between Baloo and Bagheera--an arm\r\naround each big neck.\r\n\r\n\"Art thou hurt?\" said Baloo, hugging him softly.\r\n\r\n\"I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they\r\nhave handled ye grievously, my Brothers! Ye bleed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Others also,\" said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at\r\nthe monkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride\r\nof all little frogs!\" whimpered Baloo.\r\n\r\n\"Of that we shall judge later,\" said Bagheera, in a dry voice\r\nthat Mowgli did not at all like. \"But here is Kaa to whom we owe\r\nthe battle and thou owest thy life.
