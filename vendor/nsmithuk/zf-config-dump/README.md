# zf-config-dump
A Zend Framework 2 module that provides a simple method for dumping an application's current configuration array to the commend line.

This is useful when some of the applicationâ€™s configuration is set via environment variables, as is common when using container services.

## Installing

zf-config-dump can be installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Run this command:

```sh
composer require nsmithuk/zf-config-dump
```

Then you need to add `ZFConfigDump` to your _config/application.config.php_ file under the `modules` key.

## Usage and example output

Once installed, call the following to get the whole config output:
```sh
php public/index.php dump-config
```

If you only want to return the config for a specific key, you can add a filter. For example, to just return the config for your database, you can call:
```sh
php public/index.php dump-config database
```

You can also use dot notation to access deeper keys within the config. For example, to access the value set for just the database adapter:
```sh
php public/index.php dump-config database.adapter
```
